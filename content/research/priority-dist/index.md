This work was also mainly completed during my NSERC USRA in summer 2018. I am building on the previous results by my co-researchers, particularly Maryam Mojalal's thesis, to develop the probability distribution of accumulated priority for high priority customers in the M/M/1 accumulating priority queue. I have also made progress on extending this to the affine case.
