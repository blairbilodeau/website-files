For my first undergraduate student research award, I built a simulation of patient flow through the internal medicine ward at London's university hospital. We have resubmitted a manuscript to INFOR on December 7, 2018 following a request for revisions. I presented this work at ORAHS in Oslo, Norway and CanQueue in Edmonton, Canada during the summer of 2018.
