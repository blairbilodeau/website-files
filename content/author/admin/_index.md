I'm currently a PhD student in statistics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in statistical learning and theoretical error estimation for modern machine learning techniques. My ultimate goal is to incorporate results of these nature into models which are currently used in practice. This will improve the reliability and interpretability of these tools, something which is crucial to deploying them for decisions where human lives are at stake.

My undergraduate studies were at Western University in financial modelling and mathematics. While there, I spent two NSERC undergraduate student research awards working on queueing theory results with Dr. David Stanford. My first summer I built a large simulation of an inpatient hospital unit using Python, and we are currently in the process of publishing these results. This past summer I worked on theoretical derivations of densities related to the accumulating priority queue, and the results from this require further refinement before publication.

I'm not quite sure what the purpose of this website is yet, but it seems like a good thing to have and hopefully in the near future I'll be able to make it a little less sparse. I am neither an applied statistician nor a software developer, so having cool data visualization projects (outside of those done for class) isn't really my style. But, I might add some neat mathematical investigations I do on the side just for fun. I also intend to include some of my own thoughts about the field of statistics in a Blog section.
