If you have a problem to solve or just an idea that you think is interesting, please send me an email with the details. Particularly if the problem is related to fundamental machine learning, I'd be eager to collaborate on a project. 

I also do more formal consulting for traditional statistics problems such as model fitting, inference, and interpretation. Some consulting projects I've worked on in the past involved identifying distributional differences between training and testing data, predicting travel preferences for app users, and modelling residential real estate prices.
